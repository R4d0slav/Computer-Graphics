Upon opening the index.html file, you need to insert a vector in the "Input area" in the suggested format. You can insert as many vectors you like (every vector in a new line). After that, you click the blue button "Tranform" and it shows you the transformed vectors in the same order as inserted in the "Output area".
The transformation goes as follows:
1. Translation along the x-axis by 1.25
2. Rotation along the z-axis by an angle of pi/3
3. Translation along the z-axis by 4.15
4. Translation along the y-axis by 3.14
5. Scalation along the x and y axes by 1.12
6. Rotation along the y-axis by an angle of 5*pi/8
